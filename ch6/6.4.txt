A bunch of people are living on an island, when a visitor comes with a strange order:
all blue-eyed people must leave the island as soon as possible.
There will be a flight out at 8:00pm every evening.
Each person can see everyone else's eye color, but they do not know their own (nor is anyone allowed to tell them).
Additionally, they do not know how many people have blue eyes, although they do know that at least one person does.
How many days will it take the blue-eyed people to leave?

Ans.
設有藍眼睛的人數為c，且c>0。
若c=1。有藍眼睛的那個人看到其他人都沒有藍眼睛，而他知道至少有一個人有藍眼睛，他就會知道是自己有藍眼睛，便在第1晚離開。
若c=2。有藍眼睛的人看到其他1人有藍眼睛，他們兩個各自會認為c不是1就是2。若在第1晚沒有人離開，代表自己也有藍眼睛，便在第2晚離開。
以此類推，因此他們離開的天數就等於c。
