"""
You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups).
How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?
Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.
"""
"""
Ans.
1. 將five-quart jug裝滿水。
2. 將five-quart jug的水倒往three-quart jug，直到three-quart jug裝滿水，此時five-quart jug有two quarts的水。
3. 將three-quart jug的水倒掉，把five-quart jug的水倒往three-quart jug，此時three-quart jug有two quarts的水。
4. 將five-quart jug裝滿水。
5. 將five-quart jug的水倒往three-quart jug，直到three-quart jug裝滿水，此時five-quart jug有four quarts的水，完成。
